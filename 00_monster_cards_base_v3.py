"""00_monster_cards_base_v3.
Added the 'Output Cards' function (04_output_cards_v3)
to 00_monster_cards_v2 and to the option's menu.
To do this, I also needed to add the list of cards
(03_cards_v1) so the 'Output Cards' could work.
I intentionally added the cards at the top before
all the other previously added functions as it keeps
the code more organized since the list is in one place
and all the functions are below it."""
